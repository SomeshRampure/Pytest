""" 1. OPPS -> A programming paradigm where complete software operated as bunch of objects talking to each other
        Class ->  Blueprint of an object. Building block of OPPs. It is a user defined data type that contains data members and member functions that can operate on data members.
        Object -> Instance of a class. Data members and class which cannot be used direclty without creating object of class.
        Attributes -> Variables inside a class
        Methods -> Functions inside a class
        Inheritance -> Reusing the code of parent class in child class.
        Polymorphism -> Ability to take multiple forms (Method Overloading, Method Overriding). It is the property of some code to behave differently in different conditions
        Encapsulation -> Wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some components
        Abstraction -> Hiding internal details and showing only functionality to the user. It is implemented using classes and interfaces
        __init__() -> Constructor method which is called automatically when an object of class is created. Used to initialize attributes of class.
        self -> Represents the instance of the class. Used to access variables and methods associated with the current object.
        super() -> Used to call parent class methods and constructors from child class.
        Class Variables -> Variables shared among all instances of a class.
        Instance Variables -> Variables unique to each instance of a class.
        Method Overloading -> Defining multiple methods with same name but different parameters in the same class.
        Method Overriding -> Redefining a method in child class which is already defined in parent class.
        Access Modifiers -> Public, Private, Protected access specifiers to restrict access to class members.
        Decorators -> Functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods.
        Magic Methods -> Special methods with double underscores that provide special functionality to classes (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__).
        Composition -> Building complex objects by combining simpler objects.
        Aggregation -> A specialized form of association where one class contains a reference to another class.
        Association -> A relationship between two classes where one class uses or interacts with another class.
        Dependency -> A relationship where one class depends on another class to function
        MRO (Method Resolution Order) -> The order in which Python looks for methods and attributes in a hierarchy of classes.
        Duck Typing -> An object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the actual type of the object.
